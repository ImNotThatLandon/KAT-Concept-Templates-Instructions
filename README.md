Hi! If you're reading this, then thanks. Just some basic stuff you can and can't do with the templates first:

# You Can:
+ Make any concept of a primary, secondary, skin, etc.
+ "Name" it anything (not slurs or any bypasses, as stated below)
+ Show it to other people (don't need to credit, but if they ask how, show them this github)

# You Cannot:
- Use your concepts to make fun of people (looking at you, mr. fish)
- Use your concepts as filter bypasses in the main KAT and KAT: Trading server

Just have common sense, I really can't do anything if you do the "Dont's" but like, please don't.

- Jell-O (aka. ImNotThatLandon)
